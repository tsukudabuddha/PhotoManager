# PhotoManager

## What is this?
This is a simple SwiftUI macOS app that I'm building in order to replace LightRoom (initally just for my needs). I'm currently focused on optimizing my RAW+JPEG Photography workflow and keeping my photo library organized.

## General Workflow Using Photos + PhotoManager
1. Offload photos from camera using PhotoManager
2. Import folder into Photos
3. Curate library at leiusre via iOS or mac device. Photo backups on local storage w/ PhotoManager file structure
